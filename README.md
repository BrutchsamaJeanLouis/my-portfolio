# my-portfolio

This is an ongoing challenge to test how far/advanced can a react application get without using node js. Using react for a while this is something i've always been curious about
My Finding will be logged in a logbook format

- the type of application being built have not ywt been decided (thinking of a personal development analysis portfolio)
- redux devtools extension not supported, To solve this i will use a global caller function to check the state or our app whenever needed.
- redux devtools now working. Resolved by binding Redux's applyMiddleware function to the global devtools Var
